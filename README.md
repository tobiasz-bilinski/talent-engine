# Project title

Testing framework (Talent Engine 2.0)

## About

This project is a testing framework that utilizes Pytest.

## Dependencies

Required modules are specified in requirements.txt

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests run `pytest` from the root folder.

## Structure of the framework

/conftest.py - provides Pytest fixtures for the framework   
/envs_configs - stores configuration data  
/tests - stores the tests  
/src/config - sets up configuration for the framework (connection with providers, location of test data etc.).

- config.py: contains Config class. When instantiated, it creates the config dictionary (_'conf_dict'_) and using the _'\_register'_ method receives the data from the providers and stores it in the config dictionary (raising ValueError if the item is not present in any of the providers). The _'\_\_getattr__'_ method retrieves the data stored in config dictionary. When creating an instance of the Config class, config providers must be passed in as a list in a hierarchical order:

  ```
  config = Config([JSONConfigProvider, OSConfigProvider])
  ```

  In the above example, the _'\_register'_ method called during instantiation will first look for the item in JSONConfigProvider, and if it's not present, it will look in OSConfigProvider.
  
src/data - contains test data  
src/models - contains models
- user.py - (just a practice model for now)  

src/providers - contains config providers
- base_provider.py: contains a BaseProviderClass, which raises an exception if _'\_\_getitem\_\_'_ method is not implemented in the child class. **All config provider classes must inherit from BaseProviderClass.**
 - os_config_provider.py: - contains an OSConfigProvider class. method _'\_\_getitem\_\_'_ returns the value of specified environment variable (or None if it doesn't exist).
 - json_config_provider.py: - contains a JSONConfigProvider class. method _'\_read_config'_ returns a dictionary with the contents of JSON file with path 'config_path' - _'\_\_getitem\_\_'_ returns the value of specified item in dictionary received from _'\_read_config'_. The JSON file should be located in the /envs_configs directory. **Absolute path** to JSON file needs to be passed in:
  ```
    value = JSONConfigProvider.\_read_config(insert_absolute_path_to_json_file_here)
  ```
